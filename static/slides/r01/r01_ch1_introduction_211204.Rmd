.panel[ .panel-name[Introduction]

- R is a **scripting language** for statistical data manipulation and analysis.

> The best advantage for scripting language is that you can record your actions.

<br>
- R is inspired by, and is mostly compatible with, **S language** developed by AT&T.

> S namely stands for statistics. 

<br>
- R is the initial of its two **originators**, Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka

# Why R?

--
Three things primarily attracted me to R

- The easy-to-understand-and-use syntax 

- The incredible RStudio IDE

- R Packages !!!

---
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Pros and Cons]
.pull-left[
## Pros:
- Free !!!

- Open source

- Small size

- Write your own packages !!!
]

.pull-right[
## Cons:
- Steep Learning Curve
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[R VS Stata,SPSS,Mplus,SAS]

- To some extent, **R** is like a ***mini OS*** and **Stata**, **SPSS**, **Mplus**, and **SAS** are like a collection of “packages” on the platform. 

<br>

- Technically, **R** can do everything **Stata**, **SPSS**, **Mplus** and **SAS** can do, but the later cannot do everything R can do !

]

.panel[.panel-name[R VS Python]

- Both are free and open source.

- Both are more likely mini operation systems. 

> In some specific fields, they are interchangeable. However,  **R** is more friendly to statisticians whereas **Python** is more friendly to data scientist !

# How to Learn R ?
.panelset[.panel[.panel-name[Hot Tips]

- Clarify your purpose before starting R

- Following a textbook or tutorial to familiarize R and RStudio

- Practice R with your projects by RStudio

- **Google** or **Bing** your questions when you are in trouble

- Use ***?*** function and **[help](https://www.rdocumentation.org)** documents when you forget the functions

]
.panel[.panel-name[RStudio]

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (**IDE**) for R. 
> **IDE** seems a little like a theme on computers or phones.

<br>
#### You can treat RStudio as a more friendly graphical user interface (**GUI**) than default GUI for us! 

]
.panel[.panel-name[R Packages]

To some extent, **R** is more like a mini operating system (**OS**) rather than just an applied software. 

- In **R**, we use different packages to solve different problems. 
Here **packages** are like applied software on other OSs (e.g., Windows/MacOS/Linux )

- Different packages in **R** sometimes can solve the same problem. 
> For instance, ***tidyverse*** and ***data.table*** are both excellent packages for data manipulation. 
> - They are written by different authors but solve the same problem by different logic. 
> - The differences are a little like the differences among Microsoft Word and Google Doc. 
> - You can choose either just by your preference!

.panel[.panel-name[R Markdown]

**R Markdown** is a file format for making dynamic documents with **R**.

- **R Markdown** can hep you report the results of data analysis

- **R Markdown** can help you present the results of data analysis

- **R Markdown** can help you write academic paper
